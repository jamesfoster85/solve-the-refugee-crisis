        h2 The Solution
        h3 Step 1: build local and global communities
          i.i-checkbox-checked 
        p We have a team of passionate and skilled professionals collaborating to solve the problems of the refugee crisis from across the globe. We're using 
          a(href="https://slack.com") Slack
          |  to communicate in real-time and we are growing fast.
          
        p If you're interested in starting an STRC meetup in your city, 
          a(href="mailto:admin@solvetherefugeecrisis.com?subject=STRC%20Meetup") send us a message.
          
        h3 Step 2: discover problems
          i.i-checkbox-checked
        p We are currently researching the problems that refugees, refugee representatives and organizations like  
          a(href="http://refugees-welcome.net") Refugees Welcome
          |  are facing amidst the crisis. We are interviewing founders and workers in organizations all over the world and discussing the problems we discover with our team on the Slack channel.
            
        h3 Step 3: pick a problem to solve
          i.i-checkbox-unchecked
        p Once we are confident that we have documented a sufficient range of problems and have seen good opportunities to help, we'd like to sift through our research to choose a specific problem to solve that matches our criteria:
        
        ul
          li

            strong unobtrusive 
            | prototyping & testing
          li Has a 
            strong parter organization 
            | that needs the problem solved
          li Solutions could be 
            strong measurable
        
        h3 Step 4: solve the problem
          i.i-checkbox-unchecked
        p We are going to colocate with our parter organization and apply a collaborative human-centered design process to prototype a solution. With a working prototype, we will test and measure its effectiveness and iterate into production.
        
        h3 Step 5: document process
          i.i-checkbox-unchecked
        p As we solve the problem, we are going to document our process so that we can turn it into an open-source field guide for other teams who want to solve a specific problem of the refugee crisis.
        
        h3 Step 6: empower teams
          i.i-checkbox-unchecked
        p With a working solution, field guide and body of documented problems&mdash;we want to empower other self-forming teams to replicate our process and solve another problem of the refugee crisis.
        
        p Our growing community of expert mentors can support the teams and the team members. We can provide teams with the relationships they need to succeed and ultimately work towards a better future&mdash;together...
